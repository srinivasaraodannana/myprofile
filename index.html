<div class="pic2">  “I graduating my degree in B.tech of civil department. I chose that field of study because I’ve always been interested in construction and planning, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too.
    I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.

While I don’t have any real-life work experience, I’ve had a lot of exposure to the business environment. A lot of my courses involved working with real companies to solve real problems.

Now, I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in uni and get some hands-on work experience
